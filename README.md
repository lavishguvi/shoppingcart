## Project Description
This project is a simple shopping cart application that allows users to add and remove products, update quantities, and calculate the total cost. Users can input the name and price of a product, and it will be added to the cart dynamically. The cart table displays the product name, unit price, quantity, subtotal, and an option to remove the product. The total cost is automatically calculated and displayed at the bottom.

- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styling rules to format the appearance of the shopping cart.
- `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for handling product management, updating subtotals, removing products, and calculating the total.

1. Clone the project repository:
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
